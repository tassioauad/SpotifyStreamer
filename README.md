# SpotifyStreamer 
A part of the Android Developer Nanodegree program. Built an app, optimized for tablet, that displays an artist's top 10 tracks on Spotify. The user interface allows for search capability, displays a list of the top 10 tracks in a scrolling list complete with album art, and provides streaming playback of audio using Android's mediaplayer API.

## Why this Project?

To become an Android developer, you must know how to bring particular mobile experiences to life. Specifically, you need to know how to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, and optimize the experience for various mobile devices. You will hone these fundamental skills in this project.

By building this app, you will demonstrate your understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Android. Your app will communicate with the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.
